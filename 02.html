                        <p> As we reflect on the recent 87th Induction and Turnover Ceremony of our beloved club last
                            July 13,2024 at Baguio Country Club, I am filled with a profound sense of gratitude and
                            appreciation for each and every one of you who contributed to the success of that magical
                            evening. It is with great honor and pleasure that I express my heartfelt thanks to all our
                            sponsors, the entire Rotary family and all the people present during that magical evening.
                        </p>

                        <p>The evening was truly a celebration of the enchanting theme of the Rotary Club of Baguio,
                            "The Magic of Rotary." We gathered under the promise to light up the magic within us, to
                            wield our wands of service, and to create spells of positive impact in our society.</p>

                        <p>One of the most enchanting moments was undoubtedly the captivating performance by Ms. Susan's
                            daughter and niece. Their voices, filled with the magic of talent and passion, cast a spell
                            of inspiration and set the tone for an evening of unity and fellowship.</p>

                        <p>We were also spellbound by the enlightening speeches from our outgoing President Ms Corazon
                            De Ocampo and the distinguished guest of honor, Ariel Jersey. Their words wove a tapestry of
                            wisdom and encouragement, reminding us of the transformative power we hold as members of the
                            Rotary Club of Baguio.</p>

                        <p>The opening salvo by our dedicated members was a magical display of unity and purpose, a
                            testament to the collective strength and resolve of our club. It was a moment that
                            encapsulated the essence of Rotary and the sorcery we all share for serving our community
                            selflessly.</p>

                        <p>The thrill of the raffle prizes added an element of magic and joy to the evening, sprinkling
                            sparkles of excitement and creating lasting memories of camaraderie and shared laughter. The
                            sumptuous dinner that followed was a feast for both the body and the soul, enchanting us as
                            we continued to bond and celebrate in each other's company.</p>

                        <p>The distribution of souvenir magazines was a spellbinding gesture that will serve as a
                            magical keepsake of this special evening, reminding us of the connections we have forged and
                            the moments we have shared as members of the Rotary Club of Baguio.</p>

                        <p>To each and every one of you who illuminated the magic of the event, I offer my deepest
                            thanks. Your dedication, passion, and commitment are the enchanted threads that weave the
                            tapestry of our work and the impact we have on our community. Together, we have conjured an
                            unforgettable night—one filled with love, unity, and the transformative power of Rotary
                            magic.</p>

                        <p>As we look ahead to the future under my leadership as the new President of Rotary Club of
                            Baguio, let us continue to embody the spirit of service and friendship that defines our
                            club. May we always strive to wield our wands of service with purpose and passion, creating
                            spells of positive change and illuminating the world with the magic of Rotary.</p>

                        <p>Thank you all for your unwavering support and dedication. Here's to a future filled with the
                            enchantment of Rotary magic and the promise of creating a better world through our

                        <h3>RCB Regular Meeting - June 29, 2024</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Dubbed “retrospect Awards Night” and dominated by black and white outfits, the June 29, 2024
                            RCB meeting was held at Jasper Hall, Hotel Supreme, Magsaysay Road, Baguio City. It was the
                            last for RY 2023-2024 under the leadership of Pres. Cora Ocampo. It was also the last
                            hosting for Team Pasikat, and it was ably steered by PP Chris Peralta as Program
                            Coordinator. DEI was the topic of our Guest of Honor and Speaker, AG Mary Jane Noble.</p>
                        <p>The Awards Night, which PP Veeh Balajo described as “Fabulous Awards for Members of Action
                            and Service” lending more significance to its name “retrospect”, was promptly called to
                            order by Pres. Cora at 6:00 p.m. It was started by an invocation led by IDir. Lou De Guzman,
                            followed by the singing of the Pambansang Awit, Rotary Hymn, and the 4-way Test.</p>
                        <p>IPP Ali Morales next introduced the guests in attendance, namely, RAPP Oyee Faelnar, RA Ces
                            Barrios, Rotakids Markus Ocampo and Sonny Balajo, and IDir. Lou's guest, Sandra; Rotakid Ian
                            Ocampo arrived later during the program. IPP Ali also presented the members of Team Pasikat
                            led by PP Libby Fernandez; present among the Team members, aside from PP Libby, PP Chris,
                            and IPP Ali are PDG Linda Winter, PP/Treas. Marilyn Barredo, Dir. Lorena Cachola, IDir. Lou
                            De Guzman, Asst.Treas/IDir. Ruth Rillera, and myself. A sumptuous dinner and lively
                            fellowship followed.</p>
                        <p>After dinner, Team Pasikat presented a “payong dance” for entertainment. After that, Club
                            Evaluation followed with “baby” Rotarian Harly Wasing, and “senior” Rotarian, PP Alfred
                            Laygo, as evaluators. Rtn. Harly expressed pride as an RCB member being among “brilliant
                            minds working together to help improve the community” and vowed to help improve the Club's
                            FB page to highlight RCB's accomplishments and “demonstrate to others the value of our
                            organization.”</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, congratulating Pres. Cora and the RY 2023-2024 RCB Board for a “job well
                            done” and giving them a grade of “outstanding”, PP Alfred highlighted the Club's efforts to
                            build goodwill and better friendships through its 133 activities across the seven (7) areas
                            of focus in Rotary service during the Rotary Year that led to the Club's being awarded
                            multiple Gold, Silver and Bronze Awards in the District 3790 Yearend Awards. Notably, RCB is
                            among the top clubs in the District as to service projects along with annual and polio plus
                            giving, and it was given a Gold Award as a Gold Club having 50 members during the Rotary
                            Year. Pres. Cora was also awarded a Rotarian Excellence Award, and a Silver Award for Sec.
                            Levy Orcales. Nonetheless, PP Alfred, noted that while Caῆao was consistently awarded among
                            the top club magazines in the past years, no club bulletin award was given out this Rotary
                            Year. He also noted the dwindling attendance of Club members during meetings, hence, while
                            recognizing that Rotarians are only volunteers such that they and cannot be forced to work,
                            he challenged the Club leaders to “revive”, “encourage”, and “stimulate” all the members
                            “for more interaction with one another” and to participate in meetings and other Club
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>President's Time, Pres. Cora shared her time for Sec. Levy to present a report on the Club's
                            various accomplishments for the Rotary Year notably measured in number of volunteer hours
                            (6,972 hours), funding performance (equivalent to USD24,075.78 Club funds and personal cost
                            of members), and number of volunteers (1,759 people) in the 133 Club projects that included
                            not just Club members but also from partner organizations. Pres. Cora next gave out
                            “certificate of active members” indicating their RI members' numbers and dates of induction,
                            along with individual End Polio pictures. She also gave recognition and awards to the Club
                            officers and members (“Service Above Self Enabler of the Club”), “Haligi Awards” to all Past
                            Presidents, special awards to project leads (including naming Team Pasikat as the Best Team
                            for the 3rd consecutive year!), PHF awards, Philanthropist Awards to PP Atom Mendalla for
                            her Caῆao sponsorship and IDir. Lou De Guzman for Project One, and The Rotarian of the Year
                            Award to PP Chris Faelnar.</p>
                        <p>At 9:00 p.m., after the distribution of awards, PP Libby gave her closing remarks
                            highlighting among others Rotary as Family. Then Team Pasikat gave away big blue umbrellas
                            as tokens for the Club members and guests present. And after the singing of the RCB Hymn and
                            Pilipinas Kong Mahal, Pres. Cora adjourned the meeting at 9:10 p.m., but fellowship,
                            including some dancing and a lot more picture taking, continued until 9:45 p.m.</p>
                        <p>It was another great night of Team Pasikat hosting... many thanks to everyone present who
                            made the Club's yearend event a special one especially for outgoing Pres. Cora, who bravely
                            proceeded with the event despite the passing away of her centenarian grandmother.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>The editor is responsible for the creation of all kinds of material meant to share your
                            club’s good works. But the first step is to make sure you have a good understanding of how
                            to write and what to write. Here are some tips.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make it informative. Offer useful tips, simplify anything complicated and tell people
                                what is coming up.</li>
                            <li>Make it relevant. Irrelevant content can cause readers to disregard your work. If you
                                write about things that aren’t pertinent, people may not pay attention when you write
                                about the important things.</li>
                            <li>Make it right. Always check your work for errors. You will want to be on the lookout for
                                grammar and spelling mistakes. Also be sure to fact-check — you don’t want to
                                communicate the wrong time or date and cause problems for members.</li>
                            <li>Make it concise — but complete. Write at a length appropriate for the medium. Obviously,
                                a newsletter article can be longer than a school announcement. Always make it long
                                enough to divulge pertinent information, but not so long that people get bored.</li>
                            <li>Make it visually appealing. Follow the Key Club brand guide (keyclub.org/brandguide) to
                                ensure your publications are appealing and look like Key Club. You will also want to
                                include photography and easily readable fonts.</li>
                            <li>Make it engaging. You want to help make sure your messaging is relatable. Try to create
                                content that is thought-provoking, conversational and touches on current trends. </li>
                            <li>Make it reflect your club. In photography and quotes, always be inclusive. Take
                                photography and share quotes that feature a variety of members. People are more likely
                                to read or like something they feel connected to in some way. The best way to make
                                people feel connected is to be inclusive. Before you publish any media, such as
                                photographs, get permission from every person who appears in it. For minors, permission
                                from a parent or legal guardian is also required. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It could be illegal to do otherwise. A photo release can be found on the Key Club website.

                            <p>Our Official Club Bulletin has been called The Cañao.
                                “Cañao” (pronounced as kan-yau) is actually the local
                                term for the dance during native feasts or celebrations
                                in the highlands of the Cordilleras- in Northern Luzon
                                of the Philippines.</p>
                            <p> This is depicted in our Cañao emblem which shows
                                a number of human figures in deep concentration—
                                absorbed in ritual dance.</p>
                            <p>The attention, focus, commitment and unity of
                                the club’s members is represented by the dancing
                                figures—in celebration or expectation of a bountiful
                                harvest; much as we actually do—in anticipation of
                                the joy derived from public service to the community–
                                always coupled with fellowship. Hence, the sub-title of
                                “A Celebration of Service.”</p>

                        <p>On May 26, 1972, a great historic event occurred - President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet
                            leader Leonid Brezhnev signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in Moscow. More importantly,
                            in the Philippines, in the province of North Cotabato, City of Kidapawan, located at the
                            foot of Mt. Apo, on this historic date, May 26, 1972, a handsome baby boy was born to the
                            Barrios family. </p>

                            acquired his elementary education in the Notre Dame of Kidapawan ('80-'85). Later on, he was
                            sent to Manila for his secondary education at San Sebastian College ('85-'89). (On a side
                            note, these were the times when significant political events happened in Manila,
                            specifically in the streets fronting the college). He pursued his studies and must have been
                            a very diligent student in the premier world class engineering school, the Mapua Institute
                            of Technology (now Mapua University), graduating with the course in B.S. Civil Engineering
                            in just 5 years (('89-'94).</p>
                        <p>After graduation, he was employed by Tasco, Inc., an exclusive importer of MRF, Apollo & Mega
                            tires, Alliance (from Israel), and bathroom fixtures (exclusive distributor of TOTO from
                            Japan). He rose from the ranks from the warehouse till he became a sales manager, and
                            eventually a regional manager.</p>
                        <p> While working in Tasco, Inc. in Cubao, Quezon City, Reymund was struck by Cupid with love at
                            first sight with a beautiful lass, who turned out to be working in the HSBC Bank, Quezon
                            City branch. That’s when the grandiose Mt. Apo met the beauteous Mt. Mayon, as Cecil hails
                            from Legazpi City, Albay.</p>
                        <p>“And the two became one..” </p>
                        <p>Daring and adventurous as he was, Reymund left Tasco, Inc. in 2008, and put up his own
                            company, RD’Square Enterprises, the exclusive distributor of B-Meg feeds in Baguio/ Benguet.
                            This company has been awarded almost yearly with the Quality of Excellence. </p>
                        <p>The couple finally settled in Benguet (where Mt. Pulag is.) Reymund and Cecil are truly
                            blessed with two handsome smart and intelligent sons, Rynne Daven, 20 yrs. old, and Rafael
                            Domnick, 17 yrs. old.</p>
                        <p>Reymund was invited to the Rotary Club of Baguio by previous RCB member Bennie Laranang.
                            After attending just three RCB meetings, he was surprised that he was asked to attend a
                            fireside chat. And that Saturday in 2014, he was inducted during the term of then Pres. Uwe
                            Koeller. Since then, he has been joining and initiating activities and projects, as RCB
                            director, on environmental protection, water sanitation, livelihood projects, and organizing
                            RCCs.</p>
                        <p>What enticed Dir. Reymund to Rotary was not only his love for community service but, more
                            than anything, the Four Way Test of Rotary, in everything we think, say and do. His motto in
                            life is – “It is good to be blessed, but it is better to be a blessing.” His fervent wish is
                            for RCB to carry on the ideals of service and be an inspiration to the community for a long
                            long time. He likewise wishes that RCB would recruit more members who will be active in
                            rendering service to our community. This is Dir. Reymund Barrios, a Potential Prospective
                            President of the Rotary Club of Baguio in the near future. </p>
