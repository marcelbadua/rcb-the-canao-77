              <h4>On “The Magic of Rotary”</h4>
              <hr>
              <p>Rotary International President Stephanie Urchick, a member of the Rotary Club of McMurray, Pennsylvania, USA, chose this Rotary year's presidential theme - “The Magic of Rotary” -- and called on members to recognize and amplify the organization's power to save lives.</p>
              <p>“Don't misunderstand me - we are not going to end polio or bring peace to the world by waving a wand and saying some funny words,” Urchick told incoming district governors at the Rotary International Assembly on 8 January, 2024. “It's up to you. You create the magic with every project completed, every dollar donated, and every new member.”</p>
              <p>Urchick said she saw the magic of Rotary on display when she was helping install water filters in the Dominican Republic. Two boys were watching as dirty water entered the filter, then ran out clean at the other end.</p>
              <p>“One of the boys grabbed my sleeve and said, ‘Show me the magic again,'” he said. “Obviously, the water filter wasn't magic. We worked hard to transport those filters, install them, and work with community leaders in the area to maintain them. But those boys knew that easy access to clean water would change their lives. Knowing that I played a small part in that certainly changed my life.”</p>
              <h5>Prioritizing peace</h5>
              <p>Urchick urged members to champion Rotary's Action Plan, find a balance between continuity and change, and work for peace. She plans to host a presidential peace conference in 2025 with the theme “Healing in a Divided World.”</p>
              <p>“Rotary has a long history of promoting peace through its network of peace centers..” Urchick noted. Located at top universities around the globe, the centers have trained nearly 1,800 peace fellows who are now working in more than 140 countries. The newest center, located at Bahçeşehir University in Istanbul, Turkey, will welcome its first class of fellows in early 2025.</p>
              <p>“The Rotary Peace Fellowship began more than 20 years ago to equip peace and development professionals from communities around the world to become effective catalysts for ending and preventing conflict,” Urchick said. “This conference will focus on Rotary's peace efforts and provide opportunities to learn together.”</p>
              <p>In addition to emphasizing peacebuilding, Urchick reiterated Rotary's commitment to eradicating polio. She urged the governors to join or initiate PolioPlus Societies in their districts and do all they can to help end the disease.</p>
              <p>Stephanie A. Urchick “Contact elected officials and other government leaders. Remind them that polio is still a threat. Push them to support polio eradication,” she said. “Polio remains our top priority and requires our fullest commitment, but there is so much important work to do.”</p>
              <h5>Balancing continuity and change</h5>
              <p>Urchick also underscored the necessity of balancing continuity and change, both of which animate Rotary's Action Plan.</p>
              <p>“The plan is all about building on our best ideas, not abandoning them,” she said. “We face a tough balancing act. We must change ourselves and stay true to who we are.”</p>
              <p>She asked the governors to do whatever is needed to make the club experience irresistible to members.</p>
              <p>“That might mean changing how things are done in your district,” she said. “If your district has been doing things one way for 50 years, it's probably time to reassess. If a club in your district isn't active or is losing members, maybe it's time to start a new club that fits better with the community. Just because a club or district hasn't changed in a while doesn't mean no one is hungry for change.”</p>
              <p>One way to make positive change, she said, is to embrace the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion within clubs.</p>
              <p>“I hope you'll join me in opening your arms to future people of action, even if - and in some cases, especially if - they don't look or act like the typical member of your local club,” she said. “With DEI, it is easier to be united in a common purpose. It's in those moments when we are committed and focused that we are the most effective and relevant.”</p>

              <p class="lead"><strong>I am truly happy to see all of you present at our very first regular Rotary meeting for this new Rotary Year 2024-2025, our year of MAGIC. Allow me to re-echo my acceptance speech which I think is timely and appropriate at this moment in time. </strong></p>
              <p>I stand before you with humility and gratitude as the newly elected President of this most esteemed organization. It is a great honor to be the new president of our Rotary club, and I am committed to using this opportunity to empower and inspire other women to take on leadership roles in our community. </p>
              <p>What will make my Presidency different from those of my predecessors are the perspectives and experiences that do come with being a woman. I believe in the power of collaboration, empathy, and inclusivity. I am dedicated to creating an environment where everyone's voices are heard and respected, regardless of gender or background. This year, I am enthusiastic about launching new projects. Through these initiatives, we will hopefully make a meaningful impact on the lives of those who need our help the most. </p>
              <p>My fellow Rotarians, I want to share with you my personal story which is in fact, a story of overcoming challenges, of resilience, and of hope. Growing up, I have faced my share of obstacles, trials and tribulation but I have always been guided by the strong belief that every storm eventually gives way to a colorful rainbow. It is this unwavering belief that has fueled my passion for creating positive change and addressing the humanitarian needs of our beloved city, Baguio Philippines, the City of Pines, the city that I live in, the city I love. </p>
              <p>As we embark on this journey together, I am reminded of my favorite quote by the American poet and memorist Maya Angelou: "Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud." This resonates deeply with our mission as true Rotarians. We are tasked with not only in recognizing the clouds that loom over our society but also as being the beacons of hope and positive change, the stunning rainbows that bring brilliant light and vivid color into the lives of those we serve. </p>
              <p>This year, as I previously said, we will embark on new projects that will directly impact the lives of the most vulnerable of our community. We will work tirelessly to address educational disparities, social lopsidedness and provide better access to healthcare for those in need. So please join me, and I count on each and everyone of you to participate and share your time and talent to achieve these loftly endeavors. These initiatives will not only transform lives but also sow the seeds of hope and resilience for future generations to come. </p>
              <p>In closing, I want to extend my deepest appreciation to each and every one of you. Your unwavering, unconditional support and belief in me have been the guiding light that illuminates the path we have ahead of us. Together, let us be the instruments of the change we wish to see in the world, let us be the colorful rainbows that will break through the clouds of despair, and let us create a brighter, more beneficial & abundant future for all. </p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <h3>“Mrs. Face of Tourism” is now the 12th Lady President of the Rotary Club of Baguio</h3>
              <hr>

           

              <p>As the Rotary International started to officially accept women as members of Rotary Clubs in 1989, the Rotary Club of Baguio followed suit in 1991. But it was in RY 1997 – 1998 when the Rotary Club of Baguio, on its 60 th year, “gambled” to elect a Lady Rotarian to lead the oldest Rotary Club north of Manila, the Rotary Club of Baguio, in the person of Vicenia “Veeh” Balajo. 6 years later, Linda “Linda” Winter was elected as the second RCB Lady President, who in the next decade became District Governor of RID 3790. The third RCB Lady President was Mia Joy “Mia” Cawed. During the last fifteen years, RCB was predominantly led by lady presidents -- Florence “Flo” Bayquen, Elizabeth “Libby” Fernandez (our President during RCB’s 75 th or Diamond year), Marilyn “Marilyn” Barredo, Evangeline “Gigi” Maranan, Leilani “Lani” Fabi, Gormito “Baby” Kaur (during the latter part of her term did the Covid 19 pandemic start), Alma Teresa “Atom” Mendalla ( our pandemic president), and our immediate Past President Corazon “Cora” Ocampo. Now, just 6 years after her induction, Pres. Jesusa “Susan” Villanueva will be at the helm as the 12 th Lady President, the 87 th President of the mother club of RID 3790, the Rotary Club of Baguio. </p>

              <img src=".\assets\img\f8a.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-2 float-right-md" alt="spotlight" width="">

              <p>Pres. Susan’s birthday, Christmas of 1970, represents “selflessness, forgiveness and creativity.” According to Google, a person born on this day is a “philanthropist, humanitarian, socially conscious, and deeply concerned about the state of the world”. Aptly fitting for our President Susan, isn’t it?</p>
              <p>Based on the data published by the United Nations Population Division, an estimated 121,504,132 babies were born throughout the world in the year 1970 and the estimated number of babies born on 25th December 1970 was 332,888. That would mean that Pres. Susan was one of the 231 babies delivered to this world at the minute of her birth.</p>
              <p>Two years after graduating from the Baguio Colleges Foundation (now the University of the Cordilleras), with a degree on Bachelor of Science in Information and Computer Science, Susan started working at the Land Registration Authority – Register of Deeds. She rose from the ranks till her current position as the Assistant Land Registration Examiner.</p>
              <p>Professionally, she is a member of the Chamber of Real Estate and Builders and a Past President of the Philippine Association of Real Estate Builders (PAREB), Metro Baguio Chapter.</p>
              <p>A member of the Alpha Phi Omega (APO) since she was 21 yrs. of age, Pres. Susan was the immediate Past President of the APO Baguio-Benguet Alumni Association. She is presently the President of the Baguio City Makatao Lady Eagles Group. She is also a member of the DELTANS (Disaster Environment Life-Saving Traffic Assistance Network System, Inc.), Zigzag base.</p>
              <p>In spite of her busy schedule, she finds quality time and relaxation with her two beautiful daughters, Laksmi Aloja and Krashemae Caryll, with her two energetic grandkids, Kiyo Frusciante and Kiandra Kaelle.</p>
              <p>Through the years, Pres. Susan had learned a lot on how to be a leader, a team player, a good listener and a problem solver. In the process, she learned the tedious art of patience and of handling criticisms in a positive light. Thus, for such beauty and brains, and her passion for community service, she was crowned MISS PAREB in 2019, GINANG BAGUIO in 2022, and MRS. FACE OF TOURISM in 2023.</p>

              <img src=".\assets\img\villanueva.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-2" alt="spotlight" width="">

              <p>In 2017, former Rotarian Bennie Laranang invited her to attend the Saturday meetings of the Rotary Club of Baguio. But for some reason, it took some time before she was finally inducted in April, 2018. What actually attracted Susan to pursue in joining Rotary was her experience of visiting the Rotary Building in Chicago with a co-real estate broker who was also a Rotarian, PP Carla Espinosa of RC San Fernando, Pampanga (while they were attending an International Realtors Convention in Chicago in November 2017). Such experience strengthened her resolve that when she comes back to the Philippines, she will be a member of the Rotary Club of Baguio. She felt that Rotary’s motto of “Service Above Self” is similar to APO’s guiding principle of “Leadership, Friendship and Service.”</p>

         

              <p>As an RCB member, her passion for community service finds fulfillment especially during medical missions in far-flung areas as well as activities involving women and children. Pres. Susan’s motto in life is “TO BE A RAINBOW IN SOMEONE ELSE’S CLOUD” and “ALWAYS REMEMBER TO FALL ASLEEP WITH A DREAM AND TO WAKE UP WITH A PURPOSE.” As the President of the Rotary Club of Baguio on its 87 th year of existence, she wants to be remembered as an “Authentic, Focused and Trustworthy SERVANT LEADER who strives to serve the needs of her team above her own.”</p>
              <p>Let us all rally behind and beside our President for Rotary Year 2024 - 2025 as we continue to commit ourselves to serve our club, our community, our country, and the world through “The MAGIC OF ROTARY.”</p>

              <h3>RCB Regular Meeting - 08 July 2024</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>Our meeting room was abuzz with RCB members busy catching up with each other’s current news and recent happenings, updating themselves from the last time they saw each other, while other members were occupied eating their lunch or waiting for their order to arrive. I found the table where Cousin Marilyn was sitting so I sat beside her. Our guests from RC Laoag Health Keepers and RC Laoag Sunrise were already present within our venue, namely PAR 7 for this meeting. Program Coordinator IPP Ali Morales gave the floor to President Cora Ocampo for the start of the meeting. Invocation was assigned to PP Marilyn Barredo who chose one of the prayers from Rotary Invocation booklet available & downloaded from the internet. Ruth Rillera introduced our personalities occupying the head table and the different guests present, among them Assistant Governor Mary Jane Noble of Cluster 1A, and PDG Yu Daibong from Korea. Next up was Entertainment with PDG Linda Winter, with the ABBA rendition of “I Have a Dream” with everyone singing along. Assistant Treasurer Ruth and I conducted our Raffle Draw with five grand prizes, some donated by IPP Ali Morales procured during his Singapore participation in the Rotary International Convention, and more or less three dozen consolation items. PP Libby Fernandez was at her busiest taking all the raffle winners’ photos. Pasikat member judge Mods Bahul comfortably handled Finest Moment, using the recent community service activities participated by RCB members as his basis for levying the “multa”. Irony at its best! Members Time and President’s Time went by quickly with different announcements made.</p>
              <p>DEI was the topic of our Guest of Honor and Speaker, AG Mary Jane Noble.</p>

              <p>In 2019 Rotary's Board of Directors adopted a statement that affirms its commitment to DEI and recognizes that welcoming people with differing perspectives and ideas enhances Rotary's ability to create lasting change in communities worldwide. It's crucial that everyone who engages with Rotary -- no matter who they are in the world, or how long they have been connected with Rotary – feel valued, respected, and welcomed. Rotary's capacity for doing good is amplified when we not only welcome, but actively invite, a variety of experiences, cultures, and perspective.</p>
              <p>Rotary is committed to creating an organization that is inclusive, fair to all, builds goodwill, and benefits our communities. Valuing diversity, we aim to attract and retain people with differing perspectives and ideas who will help Rotary take action to create lasting change in communities around the world. Recognizing the role equitable and inclusive practices have in creating a diverse membership, Rotary is committed to providing its clubs and members with the necessary guidance, resources, and on-going education needed to ensure that all members (current and potential) feel welcomed, respected, and valued.</p>

              <h3>RCB Regular Meeting - June 29, 2024</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>Dubbed “FAMAS Awards Night” and dominated by black and white outfits, the June 29, 2024 RCB meeting was held at Jasper Hall, Hotel Supreme, Magsaysay Road, Baguio City. It was the last for RY 2023-2024 under the leadership of Pres. Cora Ocampo. It was also the last hosting for Team Pasikat, and it was ably steered by PP Chris Peralta as Program Coordinator. DEI was the topic of our Guest of Honor and Speaker, AG Mary Jane Noble.</p>
              <p>The Awards Night, which PP Veeh Balajo described as “Fabulous Awards for Members of Action and Service” lending more significance to its name “FAMAS”, was promptly called to order by Pres. Cora at 6:00 p.m. It was started by an invocation led by IDir. Lou De Guzman, followed by the singing of the Pambansang Awit, Rotary Hymn, and the 4-way Test.</p>
              <p>IPP Ali Morales next introduced the guests in attendance, namely, RAPP Oyee Faelnar, RA Ces Barrios, Rotakids Markus Ocampo and Sonny Balajo, and IDir. Lou’s guest, Sandra; Rotakid Ian Ocampo arrived later during the program. IPP Ali also presented the members of Team Pasikat led by PP Libby Fernandez; present among the Team members, aside from PP Libby, PP Chris, and IPP Ali are PDG Linda Winter, PP/Treas. Marilyn Barredo, Dir. Lorena Cachola, IDir. Lou De Guzman, Asst.Treas/IDir. Ruth Rillera, and myself. A sumptuous dinner and lively fellowship followed.</p>
              <p>After dinner, Team Pasikat presented a “payong dance” for entertainment. After that, Club Evaluation followed with “baby” Rotarian Harly Wasing, and “senior” Rotarian, PP Alfred Laygo, as evaluators. Rtn. Harly expressed pride as an RCB member being among “brilliant minds working together to help improve the community” and vowed to help improve the Club’s FB page to highlight RCB’s accomplishments and “demonstrate to others the value of our organization.”</p>

              
              
              <p>On the other hand, congratulating Pres. Cora and the RY 2023-2024 RCB Board for a “job well done” and giving them a grade of “outstanding”, PP Alfred highlighted the Club’s efforts to build goodwill and better friendships through its 133 activities across the seven (7) areas of focus in Rotary service during the Rotary Year that led to the Club’s being awarded multiple Gold, Silver and Bronze Awards in the District 3790 Yearend Awards. Notably, RCB is among the top clubs in the District as to service projects along with annual and polio plus giving, and it was given a Gold Award as a Gold Club having 50 members during the Rotary Year. Pres. Cora was also awarded a Rotarian Excellence Award, and a Silver Award for Sec. Levy Orcales. Nonetheless, PP Alfred, noted that while Caῆao was consistently awarded among the top club magazines in the past years, no club bulletin award was given out this Rotary Year. He also noted the dwindling attendance of Club members during meetings, hence, while recognizing that Rotarians are only volunteers such that they and cannot be forced to work, he challenged the Club leaders to “revive”, “encourage”, and “stimulate” all the members “for more interaction with one another” and to participate in meetings and other Club activities.</p>
              <p>President’s Time, Pres. Cora shared her time for Sec. Levy to present a report on the Club’s various accomplishments for the Rotary Year notably measured in number of volunteer hours (6,972 hours), funding performance (equivalent to USD24,075.78 Club funds and personal cost of members), and number of volunteers (1,759 people) in the 133 Club projects that included not just Club members but also from partner organizations. Pres. Cora next gave out “certificate of active members” indicating their RI members’ numbers and dates of induction, along with individual End Polio pictures. She also gave recognition and awards to the Club officers and members (“Service Above Self Enabler of the Club”), “Haligi Awards” to all Past Presidents, special awards to project leads (including naming Team Pasikat as the Best Team for the 3rd consecutive year!), PHF awards, Philanthropist Awards to PP Atom Mendalla for her Caῆao sponsorship and IDir. Lou De Guzman for Project One, and The Rotarian of the Year Award to PP Chris Faelnar.</p>
              <p>At 9:00 p.m., after the distribution of awards, PP Libby gave her closing remarks highlighting among others Rotary as Family. Then Team Pasikat gave away big blue umbrellas as tokens for the Club members and guests present. And after the singing of the RCB Hymn and Pilipinas Kong Mahal, Pres. Cora adjourned the meeting at 9:10 p.m., but fellowship, including some dancing and a lot more picture taking, continued until 9:45 p.m.</p>
              <p>It was another great night of Team Pasikat hosting... many thanks to everyone present who made the Club’s yearend event a special one especially for outgoing Pres. Cora, who bravely proceeded with the event despite the passing away of her centenarian grandmother.</p>
